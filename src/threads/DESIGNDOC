			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
In src/threads/thread.h
struct thread
	int64_t wakeTime;	// a variable indicates the wakeTime of each sleeping thread.
In src/devices/timer.c
	struct list sleep_list;	//a list contains all sleeping threads.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
Instead of busy waiting, The sleeping thread will be blocked after
inserting it in the sleep_list in order according to its wakeTime
which equals to the summation of current time (the number of timer
ticks since the OS booted) and the time that thread should sleep.
In the timer interrupt handler, The front elements (the threads have
the smallest wakeTime) will be poped up and compare with current time.
The front threads will be unblocked until the current time will be 
bigger than the threads' wakeTime.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
The sleeping threads are inserted in the sleep_list in order according 
to the wakeTime so that the time that includes searching of the thread
with wakeTime less than the curent time would be saved.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
Synchronize the critical section of the shared code of timer_sleep()
with disabling the interrupt before entering the critical section 
and setting it back to its original intr_level after finishing the 
critical section.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
The race conditions are avoided by disabling the interrupt in timer_sleep()
and setting it back to its original intr_level when leaving the method. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
That design is easy to implement and to understand.
It improves multiprogramming as another thread can be run on the proceesor 
instead of busy waiting.
It minimizes the amount of time spent in the timer interrupt handler

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

IN src/threads/thread.h

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?
yes if 2 threads for example have the same priority which one should run 
I made a decision such that the first one int the ready list will run.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?
inside interrupt_handler
i update the priority every Time Slice to reduce the time in interrupt
handler because thread on the cpu changed every Time Slice only but require
to calculate the load avarage and recent_cpu every time frequent.

outside
calculate the priority when setting new nice value.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?
advantages:
	simple at its implementaion.
	solve the problem of blocking high priority thread of some thing
	from lower one.
disadvantage:
	reduce the preformance since the priority recalculated alot of time.

>> C6: The assignment explains arithmetic for fixed-point math in

>> decide to implement it the way you did?  If you created an
>> abstraction layer for fixed-point math, that is, an abstract data
>> type and/or a set of functions or macros to manipulate fixed-point
>> numbers, why did you do so?  If not, why not?
used define macros in implemantion which make layer of abstraction and 
improve preformance since it doesn't require calling a function.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
